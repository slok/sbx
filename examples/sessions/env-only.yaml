# Session with only environment variables, no egress restrictions.
# All network traffic passes through normally.
#
# All values are treated as literal strings — no shell expansion occurs.
# Values are single-quoted in the generated /etc/sbx/session-env.sh script,
# so $HOME, backticks, and other shell metacharacters are safe.
#
# These env vars are available in:
#   - sbx exec (sourced before your command runs)
#   - sbx shell / interactive SSH (via /etc/profile.d hook)
#
# You can also pass env vars via CLI flags:
#   sbx start my-sandbox -e KEY=VALUE -e ANOTHER=VALUE
#   sbx start my-sandbox -f session.yaml -e OVERRIDE=VALUE   # CLI wins on conflicts
#
# Usage: sbx start my-sandbox -f examples/sessions/env-only.yaml
